(Corned beef refers to the \u0026ldquo;corns\u0026rdquo; of salt once used to preserve the meat, but the seasoning has evolved to include spices like coriander and crushed juniper berries.)

The word itself is derived from two Latin words. \u0026quot;Must\u0026quot; comes from the Latin \u0026quot;mustum,\u0026quot; the first juice pressed from wine grapes. The \u0026quot;-ard\u0026quot; comes from \u0026quot;ardens,\u0026quot; meaning fiery or hot.

Most commonly, we use it to mix sauces, or for vinaigrettes. Vinaigrettes are a special case. Like hollandaise, a vinaigrette is something called an emulsion, a stable blend of a water-based ingredient (like vinegar) and an oil-based ingredient (like olive oil). Notoriously, they don\u0026rsquo;t mix well. However, if you use a tool, like a whisk, to agitate the solution, what you\u0026rsquo;re actually doing is breaking the oil up into billions of tiny particles that disperse within the vinegar, creating a smooth emulsion that has a perfect balance of richness and tang.
